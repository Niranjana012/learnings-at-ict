# Software Development Life Cycle    
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to the structured process that software development teams follow to build and maintain software applications.  
. Requirement Gathering


Identify Stakeholders: Engage with all key stakeholders, including business owners, end-users, project managers, and developers.
Collect Requirements: Gather functional and non-functional requirements, both technical and business-related, through meetings, interviews, surveys, and workshops.
Document Requirements: Create detailed requirement specifications or a requirements document that outlines the expectations for the software, including system features, user interface, performance, security, and compliance needs.
Clarify Expectations: Ensure there is a shared understanding of the scope of the software and the expected outcomes.
Outcome: A complete and clear set of requirements that serves as the foundation for design and development.

2. Analysis
   

Feasibility Study: Evaluate the technical, operational, and financial feasibility of the project.
Gap Analysis: Identify any gaps between the current system (if applicable) and the desired state.
Prioritize Requirements: Classify requirements into essential, desirable, and optional categories, helping to manage scope.
Create Use Cases and User Stories: Define user journeys and describe the interactions between users and the system.
System Specifications: Translate business requirements into functional and non-functional specifications.
Outcome: A well-defined system specification document that provides a detailed blueprint for the development phase.

4. Design
   
System Architecture Design: Decide on the overall architecture of the system, including database design, application structure, and components (e.g., client-server, microservices).
UI/UX Design: Create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes for the user interface, focusing on usability, navigation, and user experience.
Component Design: Design the individual modules or components of the software system (e.g., data access layer, business logic, user interface).
Technical Design Specifications: Create detailed design documents that describe how the system will function, including data flow, object models, algorithms, and interface designs.
Security Design: Plan for security features, such as authentication, encryption, and data protection.
Outcome: A complete design document or a set of designs that provide a blueprint for implementation, ensuring that all requirements are addressed.

6. Implementation (Development)
   

Coding: Developers begin writing the code based on the design documents. This involves translating design into functioning code using appropriate programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++) and development frameworks.
Version Control: Use version control systems like Git to manage code changes and track progress.
Adherence to Coding Standards: Follow coding conventions, guidelines, and best practices to ensure consistency and maintainability.
Unit Testing: Developers write unit tests to verify that individual components function correctly.
Outcome: A functional software product, with source code and a working version of the system.

8. Testing
   
Test Planning: Develop test plans that specify the scope, approach, resources, and schedule for testing.
Test Case Development: Create detailed test cases that describe the inputs, expected outputs, and conditions for testing each feature of the software.

Types of Testing:
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or units of code.
Integration Testing: Verifying that different modules or components of the software work together correctly.
System Testing: Validating that the entire system functions as expected in a real-world environment.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): The end users test the software to verify that it meets their needs and requirements.
Performance Testing: Testing the software for performance issues, such as load, stress, and scalability testing.
Security Testing: Ensuring that the software is secure from vulnerabilities and threats.
Bug Fixing: Identifying and fixing defects found during testing.
Outcome: A stable, bug-free software product that is ready for deployment.

10. Maintenance

Bug Fixing: Resolve any defects that were not found during the testing phase or arise after release.
Updates and Enhancements: Add new features, make improvements, or adapt to changes in the business environment or technology stack.
Performance Monitoring: Continuously monitor system performance to ensure the software runs smoothly and address any performance bottlenecks.
Security Patches: Address security vulnerabilities as they are discovered and release updates to mitigate potential threats.
Documentation Updates: Update user manuals, technical documentation, and training materials to reflect changes in the software.
Outcome: A software system that remains functional, secure, and up-to-date over time, continuing to meet usersâ€™ needs.
# Jira  
Jira is a popular project management and issue tracking tool developed by Atlassian. It is widely used for managing software development projects, tracking bugs, and handling agile workflows. Jira is especially well-known for its integration with agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban, making it a key tool for teams using these approaches.
