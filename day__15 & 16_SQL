## 1. What is a Database and its Types?  
    A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically.    
  Databases are designed to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.        
    There are different types of databases, classified based on their structure, the nature of the data they store, and how they are used.

### Types of Databases:

Relational Database (RDBMS): Stores data in tables (rows and columns) and uses SQL for querying. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.
  
NoSQL Database: Stores data in formats other than tables (e.g., key-value pairs, documents, graphs). Examples: MongoDB (document-based), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph-based).
  
Object-Oriented Database: Stores data in objects (similar to how programming languages like Java and C++ handle data). Examples: db4o, ObjectDB.
  
Hierarchical Database: Organizes data in a tree-like structure, where each child node has only one parent. Example: IBM's IMS.
  
Network Database: Similar to hierarchical databases but allows more complex relationships. Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS).
  
Distributed Database: A database where data is stored across multiple physical locations. Example: Apache Cassandra.
