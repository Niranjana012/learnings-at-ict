DAY 5 
* Normal distribution and Gaussian Distribution       
  -Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in 
  occurrence than data far from the mean. The normal distribution appears as a "bell curve" when graphed.
* Population and sampling     
  -A population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about.
   A sample is the specific group that you will collect data from.
   The size of the sample is always less than the total size of the population.
* central limit theorem
 - It states that, given a sufficiently large sample size, the distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the original population's 
  distribution
* Null hypothesis: The population mean equals the hypothesized mean.
* Alternative hypothesis: The population mean differs from the hypothesized mean.    
* The significance level, also denoted as alpha or Î±, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.   
* p valve will be (0.05) or (0.01).
 - if t value is less than alpha value,then there exist some significance.means alternate hypothesis.
